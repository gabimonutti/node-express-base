# Node Express Base

**Node Express Base** provides a foundational setup for creating a robust REST API using `Node.js` and `Express`, integrated with a SQL database via `Sequelize`.

## Features

- **Folder Structure**: Well-organized layout to kickstart API development.
- **Essential Files**: Includes:
  - `app.js`: Express application setup ready for customization.
  - Base controller and service for implementing API functionalities.
  - Environment variables (`env vars`) configuration.
  - Sequelize configuration for database connectivity (just add your credentials).

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd node-express-base
   ```
2. **Configure Your Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin <the_url_of_your_repo_here>
   ```
3. **Start building your API by customizing and expanding upon the provided base**:

This setup provides a solid starting point, ensuring you can quickly establish the groundwork for your REST API project without redundant setup overhead. Happy coding! ðŸš€
